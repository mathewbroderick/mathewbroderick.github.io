I recently moved from Bozeman, MT to Oregon, with my little puppy dog in tow, to go to graduate school at Oregon State University. I also fixed my website, which allows you to read this post right now (you're welcome!). I'm not sure quite what to do with this particular site yet, but I'd suggest checking my about tab for some content that may be a little more interesting.
