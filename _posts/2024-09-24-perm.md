I guess purchasing a new (to me) camera might persuade me to post to this a little more often. One more year left on my degree as well, then I'll have all the free time in the world.

<h1> I Got A Perm For My Camping Trip </h1>

<br>Went down to the Oregon dunes for a three night camping trip. It was a lot of fun! Did mostly a bunch of exploring. We walked down to the beach almost every day we were there and ate pretty well. Cooked all of our meals in a dutch oven on coals in a hole in the sand.<br>

<br>I did get to see my first beach sunset on the west coast! It was super cold but still very fun.

<br>Just a short post for now but I want to take about a couple video games I've been playing in a later post.
