<img src="https://i.imgur.com/612Gt06.jpg" align="left" width="200" alt="me at the japanese gardens">I'm Alexandria, my friends call me Alex. I'm a Master's candidate at the Oregon State Botany and Plant Pathology department, currently residing in Albany, Oregon. I'm an amateur artist (martial and visual), writer, programmer, and a pretty damn good cook. I'm decent at gardening as well. I own one mutt dog named Allie who is the light of my life and my best friend. This is a website meant to be a collection of my thoughts and projects, we'll see how well I stick to that goal.<br>

I was born May 9th, 1997 in the small town of Livingston, Montana in Park County. My father, James Otto Boyle, passed a few months after I was born in October of 1997. Soon after, my mother converted to Fundamentalist Christianity, and decided me and my three younger half-brothers should be homeschooled. I left home at 18 and moved to Bozeman, took a few years to learn how to be a human being, and received my GED in 2019, when I was 22. I started college at Montana State the fall afterwards, recieving my Bachelor's degree in Plant Biology May of 2023.<br>

Currently, I'm putting my effort towards completing my Master's degree and building strong lifetime relationships. I currently enjoy perfecting my cooking skills, hanging out with my dog, working on various sewing/art projects, and playing video games when I have the time. <br>

<h1>SO WHAT DO YOU DO?</h1>

<br>okay here's some stuff i've made<br>

I'm working on a novel right now. You can read it here (I'm writing it directly from the google doc): [Yeoman (a story about personal responsibility)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rm6kG8GmP_clOuyjX1ycqG9OyGlxxnhr61bwveq7qPo/edit?usp=sharing) WARNING: there is swearing/drug use/alcohol.<br>

You can read other things I've written [here](https://www.wattpad.com/user/mathewbroderick). I'm not going to bother warning you about the content, besides bad writing.<br>

I know I make posts on here, but my more personal blog is [here](https://alexandrithymia.blogspot.com/). I don't post to it very often. I made my profile when I was a teen and no, I'm not changing it. I think it's cute. <br>

My visual art gallery can be viewed [here](https://imgur.com/a/4ox4bzM).<br>

**IMPORTANT!** You can view images of my perfect, sweet dog Allie [here](https://imgur.com/a/gcKJoUR). You're welcome<br>
