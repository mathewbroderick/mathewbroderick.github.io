I'm a Master's candidate at the Oregon State Botany and Plant Pathology department, currently residing in Albany, Oregon. I'm an amateur artist (martial and visual), writer, programmer, and a pretty damn good cook. I'm decent at gardening as well. I own one mutt dog named Allie who is the light of my life and my best friend. This is a website meant to be a collection of my thoughts and projects, we'll see how well I stick to that goal.<br>

I was born May 9th, 1997 in the small town of Livingston, Montana in Park County. My father, James Otto Boyle, passed a few months after I was born in October of 1997. Soon after, my mother converted to Fundamentalist Christianity, and decided me and my three younger half-brothers should be homeschooled. I left home at 18 and moved to Bozeman, took a few years to learn how to be a human being, and received my GED in 2019, when I was 22. I started college at Montana State the fall afterwards, recieving my Bachelor's degree in Plant Biology May of 2023.<br>

Currently, I'm putting my effort towards completing my Master's degree and building strong lifetime relationships. I currently enjoy perfecting my cooking skills, hanging out with my dog, working on various sewing/art projects, and playing video games when I have the time.
