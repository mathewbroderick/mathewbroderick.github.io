<h2>Cool Stuff</h2><br>

This is a collection of cool stuff I've found over the years. It's very disorganized. **LAST UPDATED: 7/1/23**<br>

<a href="http://www.botanicalaccuracy.com/">The Botanical Accuracy site</a> - a blog listing common botanical faults in media etc. It's a pretty neat read.<br>

<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/335176">The Serendipity Gospels.</a> - A homestuck fanfiction that should be regarded as classic literature (I'm not joking).<br>

<a href="https://www.toplessrobot.com/2009/06/bonus_robs_transformers_2_faqs.php">Bonus! Rob's Transformers 2 F.A.Q.</a> - just read it<br>

<a href="https://www.debunkingskeptics.com/">SCEPCOP</a> - debunking criticism of the paranormal!<br>

<a href="https://mythoughtsbornfromfire.wordpress.com/">Aleph's Heretical Domain</a> - a blog I've kept up with over the years. Pretty interesting stuff.<br>
